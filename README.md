This project applies logistic regression to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and exercise frequency. The model was developed in Python and evaluated for accuracy.
Model Type: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
Dataset: 80 records of anonymized health data
Target Variable: Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Features Used:
Age
BMI
Blood Pressure
Glucose Level
Exercise Frequency
Glucose Level is the strongest predictor of diabetes.
BMI and Age also show strong positive correlations.
Exercise Frequency has a protective effect (negative correlation).
Blood Pressure has a moderate influence.
Individuals with glucose levels > 140 mg/dL show significantly higher risk.
BMI > 30 (obese range) correlates with increased diabetes risk.
People who exercise 3+ times/week show lower risk.
The combination of high BMI and high glucose is particularly predictive.
